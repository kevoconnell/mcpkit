## What You'll Learn

Each example includes:

- **Setup instructions** - How to generate the MCP server
- **Authentication guide** - Handling login if required
- **Available tools** - What the AI can do with the site
- **Usage examples** - Real prompts and expected results
- **Customization tips** - How to extend the generated server

## Quick Examples

### 1. Hacker News (No Auth Required)

Generate an MCP server for browsing and searching Hacker News:

```bash
mcpkit create https://news.ycombinator.com
```

**What you can do:**

- Search for articles about specific topics
- Get top stories
- Read article comments
- Find trending discussions

**Example usage:**

```
User: Search Hacker News for articles about AI safety
AI: [Uses search_articles tool with query "AI safety"]
```

### 2. Linear (Authentication Required)

Generate an MCP server for Linear project management:

```bash
mcpkit create https://mcpkit.sh
```

**What you can do:**

- Create and update issues
- Search issues and projects
- Assign tasks to team members
- Update issue statuses

**Example usage:**

```
User: Create a new high-priority bug for the login page
AI: [Uses create_issue tool with title, description, and priority]
```

### 3. GitHub (Public + Private)

Generate an MCP server for GitHub:

```bash
mcpkit create https://github.com
```

**What you can do:**

- Search repositories
- View issues and pull requests
- Read file contents
- Check commit history

**Example usage:**

```
User: Find React repositories with over 10k stars
AI: [Uses search_repositories tool with filters]
```

## Example Workflows

### Research & Monitoring

Use multiple MCP servers together to gather information:

```bash
# Set up servers for different sources
mcpkit create https://news.ycombinator.com
mcpkit create https://github.com
mcpkit create https://reddit.com

# Then ask Claude to:
# "Search HN, GitHub, and Reddit for discussions about NextJS 14"
```

### Project Management Automation

Automate your workflow across tools:

```bash
# Set up Linear and GitHub
mcpkit contexts create mcpkit.sh
mcpkit contexts create github.com

mcpkit create https://mcpkit.sh --skip-auth
mcpkit create https://github.com --skip-auth

# Then ask Claude to:
# "Create a Linear issue for each open GitHub issue with the 'bug' label"
```

### Content Curation

Gather and organize content from multiple sources:

```bash
mcpkit create https://news.ycombinator.com
mcpkit create https://medium.com
mcpkit create https://dev.to

# Then ask Claude to:
# "Find the top 5 articles about React Hooks from HN, Medium, and DEV"
```

## Best Practices from Examples

### 1. Start Simple

Begin with public websites that don't require authentication:

```bash
# Good first examples
mcpkit create https://news.ycombinator.com
mcpkit create https://producthunt.com
mcpkit create https://reddit.com
```

### 2. Save Authentication Contexts

For sites you use frequently, save contexts:

```bash
# Authenticate once
mcpkit create https://mcpkit.sh

# Reuse later
mcpkit create https://mcpkit.sh --skip-auth
```

### 3. Test Individual Tools

Use the MCP Inspector to test tools before using in production:

```bash
cd mcp-stagehand-example.com
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js
```

### 4. Combine Multiple Servers

Use multiple MCP servers together for powerful workflows:

- Research: HN + Reddit + Twitter
- Development: GitHub + Linear + Stack Overflow
- Content: Medium + Dev.to + Hashnode

### 5. Customize Generated Code

The generated servers are fully editable. Customize them for your needs:

```typescript
// Add error handling
// Improve extraction schemas
// Add rate limiting
// Cache frequently accessed data
```

## Tips for Success

<Card title="Pro Tips" icon="lightbulb">
  Learn from successful mcpkit users:
</Card>

1. **Be specific with URLs** - Use the exact page where actions happen

   ```bash
   # Instead of homepage
   mcpkit create https://mcpkit.sh/team/issues
   ```

2. **Complete authentication fully** - Including 2FA before continuing

3. **Test in Inspector first** - Validate tools before production use

4. **Handle rate limits** - Add delays between rapid requests

5. **Keep contexts fresh** - Refresh authentication periodically
