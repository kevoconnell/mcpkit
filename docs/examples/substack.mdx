This example shows how to create an MCP server for [Substack](https://substack.com), a popular newsletter and publishing platform. This demonstrates working with content platforms and managing subscriptions.

## What You'll Build

An MCP server that enables AI assistants to:
- Browse and search Substack publications
- Read newsletter posts and articles
- Navigate author profiles
- Discover trending publications
- Search content across Substack

## Generate the Server

Create the MCP server for Substack:

```bash
mcpkit create https://substack.com
```

<Info>
  For a specific Substack publication, you can use the publication's URL instead (e.g., `https://example.substack.com`)
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="URL Analysis">
    mcpkit analyzes Substack and discovers browsing capabilities.

    ```
    🔨 MCP Server Generator
    📍 Analyzing: https://substack.com
    🚀 Starting browser session...
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Action Discovery">
    The AI discovers actions for browsing and reading content:

    ```
    🔍 Discovering actions...
    ✅ Found 8 actions:
      - search_publications
      - view_publication
      - read_post
      - view_author_profile
      - browse_categories
      - get_trending
      - search_posts
      - view_post_comments
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Server Generation">
    Your MCP server is generated:

    ```
    📁 mcp-stagehand-substack.com/
    ├── src/
    │   └── index.ts
    ├── package.json
    └── tsconfig.json
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customization Ideas

### Add Newsletter Digest

```typescript
{
  name: "create_weekly_digest",
  description: "Create a weekly digest from favorite publications",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      publications: {
        type: "array",
        items: { type: "string" },
        description: "List of publication URLs"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Track Specific Topics

```typescript
{
  name: "track_topic",
  description: "Monitor Substack for posts about a specific topic",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      topic: { type: "string" },
      frequency: {
        type: "string",
        enum: ["daily", "weekly"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Export to Markdown

```typescript
// Add to read_post implementation
const markdown = `# ${post.title}

By ${post.author} on ${post.date}

${post.content}

---
Source: ${post.url}
`;

// Save or return markdown
await fs.writeFile(`posts/${post.slug}.md`, markdown);
```

## Common Workflows

### Newsletter Aggregation

Combine multiple newsletters into a single feed:

```
"Create a summary of this week's posts from my favorite tech newsletters:
Stratechery, Platformer, and The Generalist"
```

### Content Research

Research a topic across multiple publications:

```
"Search all Substack posts about Web3 from the past 3 months and
identify the main themes and controversies"
```

### Author Tracking

Follow specific authors across their publications:

```
"Track all posts from Ben Thompson and create a monthly summary
of his analysis on Big Tech companies"
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Paywall Content" icon="lock">
    Some content is subscriber-only. To access:

    1. **Authenticate:**
       ```bash
       mcpkit contexts create substack.com
       ```

    2. **Subscribe** to publications you want to read

    3. **Regenerate** the server with authentication
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Search Not Finding Posts" icon="search">
    If search returns limited results:

    1. **Use broader queries** - Try general terms first
    2. **Search specific publications** - Use `view_publication` then search within
    3. **Try author names** - Search by author for better targeting
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Slow Loading" icon="hourglass">
    Substack pages can be content-heavy:

    1. **Be patient** - Allow time for page loads
    2. **Use specific URLs** - Direct links are faster than searching
    3. **Cache results** - Store frequently accessed content
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Card title="Recommendations" icon="star">
  Tips for effective Substack automation:
</Card>

1. **Respect Rate Limits** - Don't make rapid-fire requests
2. **Cache Content** - Store posts you've already read
3. **Use Specific URLs** - Direct links are more reliable than searches
4. **Attribute Sources** - Always credit authors and link to originals
5. **Subscribe to Support** - If you regularly read a publication, subscribe

## Advanced Features

### Content Analysis

```typescript
case "analyze_publication_style": {
  // Read multiple posts
  const posts = await getRecentPosts(publicationUrl);

  // Extract text
  const content = posts.map(p => p.content).join("\n\n");

  // Analyze with AI
  const analysis = await analyzeWritingStyle(content);

  return {
    content: [{
      type: "text",
      text: JSON.stringify(analysis, null, 2)
    }]
  };
}
```

### Recommendation Engine

```typescript
case "get_recommendations": {
  const { interests } = args as { interests: string[] };

  // Search for publications matching interests
  const results = await Promise.all(
    interests.map(interest =>
      searchPublications(interest)
    )
  );

  // Rank and dedupe
  const recommendations = rankPublications(results.flat());

  return {
    content: [{
      type: "text",
      text: JSON.stringify(recommendations, null, 2)
    }]
  };
}
```
