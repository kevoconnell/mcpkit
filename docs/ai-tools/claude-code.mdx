Claude Code is Anthropic's official AI coding assistant with built-in MCP support. This guide shows you how to use mcpkit-generated servers with Claude Code.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
- Active Claude subscription (Pro, Max, or API access)
- At least one MCP server generated with mcpkit

## Quick Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate an MCP Server">
    Create an MCP server with mcpkit:

    ```bash
    mcpkit create https://news.ycombinator.com
    cd mcp-stagehand-news.ycombinator.com
    npm install && npm run build
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add to Claude Code">
    Add the server to Claude Code's MCP configuration:

    ```bash
    claude mcp add --transport stdio "hackernews" -- node /absolute/path/to/dist/index.js
    ```

    <Warning>
      Use the absolute path to your `dist/index.js` file, not a relative path.
    </Warning>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Connection">
    Start Claude Code and verify the server is connected:

    ```bash
    claude

    # In Claude, ask:
    "What MCP servers are available?"
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Workflows

### Research Assistant

```
You: Search Hacker News for articles about Rust programming language
     from the past week and summarize the main themes

Claude: [Uses hackernews MCP server to search and read articles]
        I found 12 recent articles about Rust. The main themes are...
```

### Project Management

```
You: Create a new high-priority issue in Linear titled "Fix authentication bug"
     with description "Users unable to login with OAuth"

Claude: [Uses linear MCP server to create the issue]
        I've created issue ENG-456: "Fix authentication bug"
        Priority: High
        Link: https://mcpkit.sh/team/ENG-456
```

### Multi-Server Workflows

```
You: Search Hacker News for the top React article, then create a Linear
     issue to evaluate the technology mentioned

Claude: [Uses hackernews MCP to find article]
        [Uses linear MCP to create issue]
        Created issue ENG-457 to evaluate React Server Components
```
