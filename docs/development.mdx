This guide covers how to set up mcpkit for local development and contribute to the project.

## Development Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the Repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kevoconnell/mcpkit.git
    cd mcpkit
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build the Project">
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Link for Local Testing">
    ```bash
    npm link
    ```

    Now you can use `mcpkit` command globally with your local changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Running Locally

Test your changes without building:

```bash
# Use tsx for hot reload
npm run dev create https://example.com

# Or run commands directly
npx tsx src/cli.ts create https://example.com
npx tsx src/cli.ts secrets
npx tsx src/cli.ts contexts list
```

## Contributing

### Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Test thoroughly with multiple websites
5. Commit (`git commit -m 'feat: add amazing feature'`)
6. Push (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

### Commit Convention

Use conventional commits:
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

<Info>
  **Prerequisites**:
  - Node.js version 19 or higher
  - A docs repository with a `docs.json` file
</Info>

Follow these steps to install and run Mintlify on your operating system.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the Mintlify CLI">

```bash
npm i -g mint
```
</Step>

<Step title="Preview locally">

Navigate to your docs directory where your `docs.json` file is located, and run the following command:

```bash
mint dev
```

A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Custom ports

By default, Mintlify uses port 3000. You can customize the port Mintlify runs on by using the `--port` flag. For example, to run Mintlify on port 3333, use this command:

```bash
mint dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Mintlify on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Mintlify versions

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local preview does not align with the production version, please update the CLI:

```bash
npm mint update
```

## Validating links

The CLI can assist with validating links in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

## Deployment

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

  <img src="/images/checks-passed.png" alt="Screenshot of a deployment confirmation message that says All checks have passed." style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

## Code formatting

We suggest using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>

    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:
    1. Remove the currently-installed version of the CLI: `npm remove -g mint`
    2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.
    3. Reinstall the CLI: `npm i -g mint`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
  
    Solution: Go to the root of your device and delete the `~/.mintlify` folder. Then run `mint dev` again.
