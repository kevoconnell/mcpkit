This guide will walk you through creating your first MCP server using mcpkit. You'll generate a server for Hacker News that can search and extract articles.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

- Node.js 18 or later installed
- A Browserbase API key ([sign up here](https://www.browserbase.com))
- An LLM API key (Gemini recommended for best results)

<Note>
  Don't have API keys? You can get a free Browserbase API key and a free Gemini API key to get started.
</Note>

## Step 1: Install mcpkit

Install mcpkit globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @kevinoconnell/mcpkit
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
mcpkit version
```

<Check>
  You should see the version number printed to the console.
</Check>

## Step 2: Configure API Keys

Run the secrets setup command:

```bash
mcpkit secrets
```

You'll be prompted to enter:

1. **Browserbase API key** - Get yours at [browserbase.com](https://www.browserbase.com)
2. **LLM provider and API key** - Choose from:
   - Google Gemini (recommended)
   - OpenAI
   - Anthropic
   - Azure OpenAI

<Tip>
  We recommend using Google Gemini 2.5 pro for the best balance of speed and quality.
</Tip>

Your credentials are stored securely in:
- macOS/Linux: `~/.mcpkit/secrets.json`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.mcpkit\secrets.json`

## Step 3: Create Your First MCP Server

Let's create an MCP server for Hacker News:

```bash
mcpkit create https://news.ycombinator.com
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Website Analysis">
    mcpkit will launch a browser session and analyze the website to discover available actions.

    <Info>
      This step uses Browserbase to run a headless browser in the cloud, so you don't need Chrome installed locally.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authentication (Optional)">
    If the website requires authentication, you'll be prompted to log in through a live browser session.

    ```
    🔐 This site may require authentication.
    Would you like to authenticate? (Y/n)
    ```

    Your authentication context will be saved for future use.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Action Discovery">
    mcpkit will automatically discover actions like:
    - Searching for articles
    - Reading article content
    - Extracting comments
    - Navigating pages
  </Step>

  <Step title="Server Generation">
    A complete MCP server will be generated in a new folder:

    ```
    📁 mcp-stagehand-news.ycombinator.com/
    ├── src/
    │   ├── index.ts        # Main MCP server
    │   └── tools/          # Generated tools
    ├── package.json
    └── tsconfig.json
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  Your MCP server has been successfully generated!
</Check>

## Step 4: Test Your MCP Server

Navigate to the generated folder:

```bash
cd mcp-stagehand-news.ycombinator.com
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Build the server:

```bash
npm run build
```

Test with the MCP Inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js
```

  <img src="/HNMCP.png" alt="MCP Inspector showing Hacker News server tools" />
</Frame>

You should see a list of available tools that the AI can use to interact with Hacker News.

## Step 5: Use with Claude Code

To use your MCP server with Claude Code, add it to your MCP configuration:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio "hackernews" -- node dist/index.js
```

Now you can ask Claude to:
- "Search Hacker News for articles about AI"
- "Get me the top story from Hacker News"
- "Find discussions about React on HN"

<Tip>
  Make sure to provide the absolute path to `dist/index.js` if you're adding the server from a different directory.

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Browser session fails to connect" icon="wifi">
    Make sure your Browserbase API key is valid and you have an active internet connection.

    ```bash
    # Check your secrets
    mcpkit secrets show
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Action discovery finds no actions" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Some websites have dynamic content that loads slowly. Try:
    - Using a more specific URL (e.g., a specific page rather than the homepage)
    - Ensuring the website is accessible and not behind a paywall
    - Checking if the website requires authentication
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Generated server doesn't work" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Common fixes:
    - Make sure you ran `npm install` and `npm run build`
    - Check that Node.js version is 18 or later
    - Verify your Browserbase API key is still valid
    - Try regenerating the server with `mcpkit create` again
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication context not saving" icon="lock">
    Authentication contexts are stored per domain. Make sure:
    - You completed the authentication flow
    - The domain matches (www.example.com vs example.com)
    - You have write permissions to `~/.mcpkit/contexts/`
